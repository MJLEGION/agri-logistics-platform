# How to Test the Logistics Upgrade

## Quick Start - 3 Easy Steps

### Step 1: Add Test Screen to Navigation

Find your transporter navigation stack (usually in `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` or similar).

**Add this import:**
```typescript
import TestScreen from '../screens/TestScreen';
```

**Add this screen to your stack:**
```typescript
<Stack.Screen
  name="LogisticsTest"
  component={TestScreen}
  options={{ title: 'Run Tests' }}
/>
```

### Step 2: Add a Button to Access Tests

In your `TransporterHomeScreen` or any screen, add a button:

```typescript
<TouchableOpacity
  style={styles.testButton}
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('LogisticsTest')}
>
  <Ionicons name="flask" size={20} color="#FFF" />
  <Text style={styles.testButtonText}>Run Tests</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### Step 3: Run the Tests

1. Open your app
2. Navigate to the Transporter section
3. Tap "Run Tests" button
4. Tap "Run All Tests"
5. View results!

   - âœ… Daily earning potential card
   - âœ… Best matches (top 3)
   - âœ… Match scores and reasons

### Test 2: Load Matching

1. Go to Available Loads screen
2. Check that each load shows:
   - âœ… Distance to pickup
   - âœ… Route distance
   - âœ… Estimated earnings
   - âœ… Earnings displayed correctly

### Test 3: Earnings Dashboard

1. Go to Earnings Dashboard
2. Switch between time periods:
   - âœ… Today
   - âœ… This Week
   - âœ… This Month
   - âœ… This Year
3. Verify:
   - âœ… Net earnings calculated correctly
   - âœ… Charts display (for weekly view)
   - âœ… Breakdown shows gross/fuel/net
   - âœ… Recent trips list accurate

### Test 4: Vehicle Profile

1. Go to Vehicle Profile screen
2. Click Edit
3. Change vehicle details
4. Save changes
5. Verify:
   - âœ… Changes persist
   - âœ… Validation works
   - âœ… Statistics update

### Test 5: Trip History

1. Go to Trip History screen
2. Test filters:
   - âœ… All trips
   - âœ… Completed only
   - âœ… In progress only
   - âœ… Accepted only
3. Test sorting:
   - âœ… Recent first
   - âœ… Highest earnings first

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found: routeOptimizationService"
**Solution:** Make sure the file exists at `src/services/routeOptimizationService.ts`

### Issue: "Cannot read property 'latitude'"
**Solution:** Ensure test loads have valid pickup/delivery locations

### Issue: Tests show 0 matches
**Solution:** Make sure you have some pending/accepted orders without transporters

### Issue: Distance seems wrong
**Solution:** Remember we calculate "as the crow flies" (straight line), not road distance. This is expected and correct!

---

## Understanding Test Results

### Distance Calculations
- **Straight-line distance:** What we calculate (Haversine formula)
- **Road distance:** Usually 1.4-1.8x longer
- **Example:** Kigali to Butare
  - Our calculation: ~75 km âœ…
  - Google Maps road: ~125 km âœ…
  - Both are correct! Different purposes.

### Why Straight-Line is Used:
1. **Fast** - No API calls
2. **Offline** - Works without internet
3. **Consistent** - Same everywhere
4. **Accurate for proximity** - Great for "loads near you"
5. **Good estimates** - Within 30% of road distance

### When to Use Road Distance:
- Final payment calculations
- Customer-facing estimates
- Legal compliance
- Precise ETA requirements

---

## Performance Benchmarks

Your tests should complete:
- **Distance calculation:** <1ms âš¡
- **Load matching (100 loads):** <10ms âš¡
- **Complete test suite:** <2 seconds âš¡

If slower, there may be an issue.

## Next Steps After Testing

1. âœ… If all tests pass â†’ Ready for user testing!
2. âœ… If some tests fail â†’ Check error messages
3. âœ… Test on real device (not just simulator)
4. âœ… Test with different data scenarios
5. âœ… Get feedback from real transporters

## Support & Debugging

### View Detailed Logs
The test screen shows detailed console logs. Look for:
- âœ“ PASS - Test succeeded
- âœ— FAIL - Test failed (check expected vs actual)
- === - Section headers

### Quick Debug Commands

**Test distance calculation:**
```javascript
import { calculateDistance } from './services/routeOptimizationService';
const dist = calculateDistance(-1.9403, 29.8739, -2.5974, 29.7399);
console.log('Distance:', dist, 'km'); // Should be ~74-75 km
```

**Test earnings:**
```javascript
import { calculateEarnings } from './services/routeOptimizationService';
const earnings = calculateEarnings(50);
console.log('Earnings:', earnings, 'RWF'); // Should be 60,000
```

**Test matching:**
```javascript
import { findBestMatches } from './services/loadMatchingService';
const matches = findBestMatches(currentLocation, availableLoads);
console.log('Best match score:', matches[0]?.score); // Should be > 100
```
