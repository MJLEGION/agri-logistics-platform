## 🖼️ How Images Work

### Service: `cropImageService.ts`

```typescript
// Get image for any crop
getCropImage("tomato"); // Tomato image
getCropImage("chicken"); // Chicken image
getCropImage("maize"); // Maize image
getCropImage("potatoes"); // Potato image
getCropImage("beef"); // Beef image
```

### Used In:

1. **BrowseCropsScreen** - Grid cards
2. **PlaceOrderScreen** - Detail view
3. **MyListingsScreen** - Farmer's crops
4. **AvailableLoadsScreen** - Transport loads
