   ```

### SHOULD DO (Recommended):

4. **Test with Test Keys First**

## 🔧 Backend Integration Required

### Endpoint 1: Initiate Payment

```javascript
POST /api/payments/flutterwave/initiate
Body: {
  amount: 50000,
  phoneNumber: "+250788123456",
  orderId: "ORD_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  paymentMethod: "momo" // auto-detected from phone
}
Response: {
  success: true,
  status: "pending",
  referenceId: "FW_ORD_123_1234567890",
  message: "Payment initiated"
}
```

### Endpoint 2: Check Status

```javascript
GET /api/payments/flutterwave/status/:referenceId
Response: {
  success: true,
  status: "completed", // or "pending" or "failed"
  transactionId: "5739194928",
  message: "Payment successful"
}
```

### Endpoint 3: Verify Payment

```javascript
POST /api/payments/flutterwave/verify
Body: {
  transactionId: "5739194928",
  referenceId: "FW_ORD_123_1234567890"
}
Response: {
  success: true,
  message: "Payment verified successfully"
}
```

## 🔐 Security Requirements

### Frontend (Safe)

- ✅ Public Key: `pk_live_xxxxx`
- ✅ Can be in code/env

### Backend Only (NEVER frontend)

- 🔒 Secret Key: `sk_live_xxxxx`
- 🔒 Must be in backend .env
- 🔒 Never expose or log it
- 🔒 Use environment variables

### Best Practices

- ✅ Validate amount on backend
- ✅ Verify user authentication
- ✅ Log all transactions
- ✅ Store transaction reference
- ✅ Use HTTPS only
- ✅ Add rate limiting
- ✅ Implement CORS correctly

6. Frontend polls: /api/payments/flutterwave/status every 5 sec
7. User confirms: On their phone
8. Frontend detects: Payment success
9. Order created: In database
10. User redirected: To Home with confirmation
```

## 📱 System Requirements

### Frontend

- ✅ React Native (Expo)
- ✅ Axios (already installed)
- ✅ AsyncStorage (already installed)
- ✅ React Navigation (already installed)

### Backend

- Need: Node.js + Express
- Need: axios for HTTP requests
- Need: dotenv for environment variables
- Need: Authentication middleware

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Secret Key Error"

```
Error: Cannot read property 'slice' of undefined
→ Backend .env not set
→ Fix: Add FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY to backend .env
```

### Issue: "Could not detect provider"

```
Phone: +250987654321 (wrong prefix)
→ Prefix must be: 078, 079 (MTN) or 072, 073, 075 (Airtel)
→ Fix: Use correct number
```

### Issue: Payment stuck "pending"

```
User didn't confirm on phone
→ User must enter PIN on their phone
→ Max wait: 5 minutes then timeout
→ User can retry
```

### Issue: CORS Error

````
Backend not allowing frontend
→ Fix: Add CORS headers:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: ['http://localhost:8081', 'your-app-url'],
  credentials: true
}));
````
