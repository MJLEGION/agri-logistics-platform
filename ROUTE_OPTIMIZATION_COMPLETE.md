## 🚀 Quick Usage Examples

### 1️⃣ Create Multi-Stop Route

```typescript
import {
  createOptimizedRoute,
  startRouteTracking,
} from "../services/smartRouteOptimizationService";

const route = createOptimizedRoute(
  "transporter_001",
  { latitude: -1.97, longitude: 30.1, address: "Hub" },
  stops // Array of farm pickup/delivery points
);

console.log(`Total distance: ${route.totalDistance} km`);
console.log(`Total earnings: ${route.totalEarnings} RWF`);

// Start real-time tracking
await startRouteTracking(route.routeId);
```

### 2️⃣ Send Delivery Alerts

```typescript
import { notifyTransporterEnRoute } from "../services/deliveryAlertsService";

// Farmer automatically gets SMS when transporter is assigned
await notifyTransporterEnRoute(
  "order_123",
  {
    id: "farmer_1",
    name: "John",
    phone: "+250788123456",
    pickupAddress: "Farm",
  },
  { id: "transporter_1", name: "Kamali Transport", vehicleType: "Truck" },
  25 // ETA in minutes
);
```

### 3️⃣ Display Alerts to Farmer

```typescript
import { DeliveryAlertsPanel } from "../components/DeliveryAlertsPanel";

export function FarmerDashboard() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  return <DeliveryAlertsPanel farmerId={user.id} />;
}
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Batch Alerts

Instead of sending individual alerts, batch multiple farmers' alerts to reduce SMS costs.

### Tip 2: Smart Scheduling

Adjust update frequency based on time of day - faster updates during peak hours, slower at night.

### Tip 3: Regional Optimization

Use region-specific traffic patterns to improve ETA accuracy.

### Tip 4: Cache Results

Cache frequently calculated routes to improve performance.

### Tip 5: Analytics

Track which alerts have highest engagement to optimize messaging.
