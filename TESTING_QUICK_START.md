## 🚀 Step 1: Install Test Dependencies (2 minutes)

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest @react-native-testing-library
```

Or run this directly:

```powershell
npm install --save-dev jest "@types/jest" ts-jest "@react-native-testing-library"
```

## 🔧 Step 2: Update package.json (1 minute)

Add these lines to your `package.json` scripts section:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "test:rating": "jest ratingService.test",
    "test:review": "jest reviewService.test",
    "test:advanced": "jest advancedRatingsService.test"
  }
}
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: Run Tests (Choose One)

### Run ALL tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Run in watch mode (re-run on file changes):

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Run with coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Run specific test file:

```bash
npm run test:rating      # Only rating service tests
npm run test:review      # Only review service tests
npm run test:advanced    # Only advanced features tests
```

### Run specific test:

```bash
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should create a rating"
```

## 🧪 Manual Testing in App (Part 2)

While unit tests verify the logic, you should also test the UI manually:

### Test Rating Screen:

1. Open your app
2. Complete a delivery
3. Navigate to RatingScreen
4. Try these:
   - ⭐ Click different star ratings
   - 💬 Type a comment
   - ✅ Submit the rating
   - ✔️ See success message

### Test Transporter Profile:

1. View a transporter profile
2. Check:
   - 🏆 Badge displays correctly
   - ⭐ Rating stars show
   - 📊 Distribution bars visible
   - 💬 Reviews load
   - 👍 Helpful voting works
   - 🔄 Pull-to-refresh works

See `RATINGS_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for detailed manual testing scenarios.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Cannot find module 'ts-jest'"

```bash
npm install --save-dev ts-jest
```

### Error: "Cannot find module '@react-native-async-storage'"

This is normal - it's mocked in the test environment. The mock in `setup.ts` handles it.

### Tests timing out

Increase timeout in jest.config.js:

```javascript
testTimeout: 20000, // 20 seconds
```

### Tests not found

Make sure test files are in:

- `src/tests/*.test.ts`
- `src/**/*.test.ts`
- `src/**/*.spec.ts`

### AsyncStorage mocking errors

Check that `setup.ts` is being loaded:

```javascript
// jest.config.js
setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/tests/setup.ts'],
```

## 📈 Coverage Report

After running `npm run test:coverage`, check:

```
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
File                            | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
services/ratingService.ts       |    90   |    88    |    92
services/reviewService.ts       |    85   |    82    |    87
services/advancedRatingsService |    80   |    78    |    82
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
All files                       |    85   |    83    |    87
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

✅ **Target: 80%+ coverage**

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Run test in watch mode and see changes:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

This re-runs tests when you save files - great for TDD!

### Run only failed tests:

```bash
npm test -- --onlyChanged
```

### Debug a single test:

```bash
npm test -- ratingService.test.ts --verbose
```

### Update snapshots (if you add snapshot tests):

```bash
npm test -- --updateSnapshot
```

### See which tests are slowest:

```bash
npm test -- --verbose --logHeapUsage
```

## 🔄 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

1. **Start watch mode:**

   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   ```

2. **Keep it running** in a terminal

3. **Code in your service** and save

4. **Tests auto-run** - see green ✅ or red ❌

5. **Fix code** until all green

6. **Done!** No need to restart
