## 💡 How It Works Now

### Before (Mock)

```
User → Pay Now → Mock payment (always succeeds) → Order created
```

### After (Live with Flutterwave) ✅

```
User → Pay Now
  → Frontend sends to Backend
  → Backend calls Flutterwave securely
  → Flutterwave sends prompt to user's phone
  → User enters PIN on phone
  → Frontend polls backend every 5 seconds
  → Backend checks with Flutterwave
  → Payment confirmed
  → Order created
  → SMS notification sent
```
