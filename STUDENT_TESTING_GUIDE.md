## üí° Pro Tips for Success

### Recording the Video

1. **Plan your recording** - Do a dry run first
2. **Use landscape mode** - Better for mobile recording
3. **Speak clearly** - Good audio is important
4. **Go slow** - Give viewers time to see each step
5. **Show results** - Pause after each action to show what happened
6. **Use captions** - Add text labels for key points
7. **High quality** - Record at 1080p or 4K
8. **Close backgrounds** - Minimize distracting apps
9. **Good lighting** - Ensure screen is clearly visible
10. **Test audio** - Check microphone before recording

### Testing Systematically

1. **Create a test plan** - Know what you're testing before you start
2. **Document as you go** - Don't rely on memory later
3. **Be thorough** - Test happy paths AND error cases
4. **Test multiple times** - Performance varies, average results
5. **Vary conditions** - Test on different networks, devices, with different data
6. **Look for bugs** - While testing, note any issues
7. **Ask yourself** - "Would a real user encounter this?"
8. **Be objective** - Record what actually happens, not what should happen

### Analyzing Results

1. **Compare to objectives** - Did you achieve what was proposed?
2. **Compare across devices** - Is there a pattern?
3. **Look for bottlenecks** - What's slowest?
4. **Identify root causes** - Why is performance like this?
5. **Propose solutions** - How could it be improved?
6. **Think strategically** - What matters most for users?

## üìû Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: Can I test only on web browser?**

A: Ideally test on multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Web), but at minimum test on Android or web to show mobile-first design.

### **Q: How do I measure performance if I don't have device profilers?**

A: Use simple stopwatch for startup time, Chrome DevTools for web, and record screenshots of metrics when possible.

### **Q: What if I find bugs during testing?**

A: Document them! Note:

- What causes the bug
- When it occurs
- Impact on user
- Any error messages
- Recommendations to fix

Then fix and re-test if time permits.

### **Q: Can I record on a Mac?**

A: Yes! Use built-in screen recording (Cmd+Shift+5) or Screenium for better quality.

### **Q: How do I optimize video file size?**

A: Use OBS output settings:

- Bitrate: 8-12 Mbps
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Format: MP4

### **Q: Should I include failures in the video?**

A: Yes! Show:

- How app handles errors gracefully
- Validation messages for bad input
- Recovery from errors
- Edge case handling

This demonstrates robust error handling!

### **Q: How much analysis do I need to write?**

A: For each objective/feature:

- Did it work? Yes/No/Partial
- How do you know?
- What's the evidence?
- Any issues encountered?
- Recommendations?
