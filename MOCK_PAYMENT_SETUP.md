# 🎓 Mock Payment Integration for Final Project

## Status: ✅ READY TO USE

Your project now uses a **mock/simulated payment system** that works without real Flutterwave credentials. Perfect for your final project demo!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Payment Flow

1. **User enters phone number** → Auto-detects MTN MoMo or Airtel Money
2. **Clicks "Pay Now"** → Mock payment is initiated
3. **Simulated processing** → Payment processes over 3-8 seconds (realistic!)
4. **Results** → 85% success rate for demo purposes
5. **Order created** → Upon successful payment

### Key Features

✅ No API credentials needed  
✅ Works offline  
✅ Realistic 3-8 second processing delays  
✅ Phone number validation for Rwanda operators  
✅ 85% success rate (15% simulated failures for demo)  
✅ Transaction history stored locally

---

## 📱 Test the Payment

### Test Phone Numbers

**MTN MoMo (078/079):**

```
0788123456  → Will auto-detect as MTN MoMo
0790123456  → Will auto-detect as MTN MoMo
```

**Airtel Money (072/073/075):**

```
0720123456  → Will auto-detect as Airtel Money
0730123456  → Will auto-detect as Airtel Money
```

### Test Amounts

```
100 - 1,000,000 RWF
```

### Expected Behavior

1. Enter any valid phone number
2. Enter any amount
3. Click "Pay Now"
4. Wait 3-8 seconds (simulated processing)
5. ✅ Payment completes (85% of time)
6. ✅ Order is created
7. ✅ You see success screen

## 📁 Files Changed

### New File Created:

- `src/services/mockPaymentService.ts` - Full mock payment implementation

### Updated Files:

- `src/components/MomoPaymentModal.tsx` - Now uses mock service instead of Flutterwave

### Original Files (Kept for Reference):

- `src/services/flutterwaveService.ts` - Can be used when switching to live later
- `src/services/momoService.ts` - Alternative MoMo service

---

## 🔄 Switch to Real Flutterwave Later

When you're ready to go live with real payments:

### Step 1: Get Flutterwave Credentials

```
1. Go to https://dashboard.flutterwave.com
2. Create business account (for your company)
3. Get Public + Secret keys
```

### Step 2: Create Backend Endpoint

Use the code from `FLUTTERWAVE_INTEGRATION.md`:

```javascript
POST /api/payments/flutterwave/initiate
GET /api/payments/flutterwave/status/:referenceId
POST /api/payments/flutterwave/verify
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend

Replace imports in `MomoPaymentModal.tsx`:

**FROM:**

```typescript
import {
  initiateMockPayment,
  checkMockPaymentStatus,
} from "../services/mockPaymentService";
```

**TO:**

```typescript
import {
  initiateFlutterwavePayment,
  checkFlutterwavePaymentStatus,
} from "../services/flutterwaveService";
```

### Step 4: Update Function Calls

```typescript
// Replace in handlePayment():
// const result = await initiateMockPayment({...})
const result = await initiateFlutterwavePayment({...})

// Replace in pollPaymentStatus():
// const statusResult = await checkMockPaymentStatus(referenceId)
const statusResult = await checkFlutterwavePaymentStatus(referenceId)
```

## 🎬 Demo Script

Use this for your presentation:

```
1. Open the app
2. Go to place an order
3. Proceed to payment
4. Enter phone: 0788123456
5. Enter amount: 50000 RWF
6. Click "Pay Now"
7. Wait for processing (3-8 seconds)
8. Show success screen
9. Explain: "In production, user would see real MoMo prompt on their phone"
```

---

## 💡 Why This Approach?

✅ **For Students:** No business verification needed  
✅ **For Demos:** Shows realistic payment flow  
✅ **For Development:** Fast testing without API calls  
✅ **For Production:** Easy to swap in real payments  
✅ **For Learning:** Understand payment flow without credential hassles

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid phone number"

- Make sure phone is 9 digits
- Use MTN (078/079) or Airtel (072/073/075)
- Format: 0788123456 or +250788123456

### "Payment still processing"

- This is normal (simulates real delays)
- Maximum wait is ~10 seconds for demo
- In production, depends on network

### "Payment failed randomly"

- This is **intentional** (15% failure rate for demo)
- Shows how your app handles payment failures
- Try again to get different result

---

## 📊 What Happens in Background

### Initiate Payment:

```
1. Validate phone number
2. Generate unique transaction ID
3. Store in local memory
4. Simulate 1-2 second network delay
5. Return reference ID
```

### Check Status:

```
1. Look up transaction by reference ID
2. Check elapsed time since initiation
3. After 3-8 seconds → Mark as completed/failed
4. Return current status
5. Repeat until final status
```

## 🎓 Learning Points

This mock service teaches you:

- ✅ Payment flow architecture
- ✅ Asynchronous processing
- ✅ Status polling pattern
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ User feedback during processing
- ✅ Transaction management

---

## 📝 Notes

- Mock payments are stored in **memory only** (cleared on app restart)
- No real money involved
- Perfect for classroom/lab demonstrations
- Easily extensible for future integrations
