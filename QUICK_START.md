# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Agri-Logistics Platform v2.0

## 📋 What Changed?

Your app is now **logistics-focused** with transporters as the primary user role. All existing features still work!

### In 3 Bullets:
1. **Roles renamed**: farmer→shipper, buyer→receiver (legacy still works)
2. **Trip is primary**: Everything revolves around transportation trips
3. **Auto-sync**: Orders and trips automatically stay synchronized

## 🔧 What You Can Do Now

### Already Working ✅
- Login with any role (legacy or new)
- Navigate to role-specific screens
- View mock trip data (transporter)
- All existing farmer/buyer features

### Ready to Integrate 📋
- Sync service (created, needs wiring to Redux)
- Auto-create trips from orders
- Real-time status synchronization
- Enhanced logistics dashboard

---

## 🎯 Common Tasks

### Test Login Flow
```bash
# 1. Start app
npm start

# 2. Login as transporter
Phone: +250700000003
Password: password123

# 3. Check console for this log:
# 🚚 AppNavigator - role: transporter, normalized: transporter
```

### Check Role Mapping
Login with legacy role "farmer":
```
Phone: +250700000001
Password: password123

Console shows:
🚚 AppNavigator - role: farmer, normalized: shipper
```
✅ Automatic role normalization working!

### View Mock Trips
Login as transporter → Dashboard shows:
- TRIP_001: In Transit (25,000 RWF)
- TRIP_002: Completed (45,000 RWF)
- TRIP_003: Available (45,000 RWF)
- TRIP_004: Available (70,000 RWF)

---

## 🔄 How Sync Works

### Current State (Phase 1) ✅
```
Order Created → Trip manually created
Trip Updated → Order manually updated
```

### After Integration (Phase 2) 📋
```
Order Created → Trip AUTO-created by sync service
Trip Updated → Order AUTO-synced
```

**To enable**: Wire `logisticsSyncService` to Redux thunks

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2)
1. **Wire Sync to Redux**
   - Update `ordersSlice.ts` → call `createTripFromOrder()`
   - Update `tripsSlice.ts` → call `syncOrderFromTrip()`

2. **Update UI Text**
   - "Farmer" → "Shipper"
   - "Buyer" → "Receiver"
   - "Crop" → "Cargo"
   - "Harvest Date" → "Ready Date"

3. **Test Complete Flow**
   - Receiver places order
   - Trip auto-created
   - Transporter accepts trip
   - Order status auto-updates
   - Complete trip
   - Both entities synced

### Future (Phase 3)
- Multi-stop optimization
- Fleet management
- Real-time WebSockets
- Push notifications
- Payment integration
- Rating system

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Console Logging
Look for these emojis in console:
- 🚚 Navigation/routing
- 📦 Trip operations
- 🔄 Sync events
- ✅ Success
- ❌ Errors

### Redux DevTools
Monitor these stores:
- `state.trips` - Trip data (primary)
- `state.orders` - Order data (syncs with trips)
- `state.auth` - User role & auth

### Type Safety
All changes are type-safe with aliases:
```typescript
Crop = Cargo  // Legacy alias works
Order = ShipmentOrder  // Legacy alias works
'farmer' → 'shipper'  // Auto-normalized
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Login not working
**Check**: Are you using the correct phone numbers?
```
+250700000001 (shipper)
+250700000002 (receiver)
+250700000003 (transporter)
```

### Issue: Wrong screens showing
**Check**: Console for role normalization:
```
🚚 AppNavigator - role: farmer, normalized: shipper
```

### Issue: Trips not showing
**Check**: Login as transporter (ID: '3')
- TRIP_001 and TRIP_002 assigned to you
- TRIP_003 and TRIP_004 available to accept

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Fix**: Run `npm install` to ensure all types are loaded

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Trip = Primary Entity
Everything revolves around trips:
- Transporters accept/complete trips
- Trips link to orders
- Earnings calculated per trip
- Status drives the flow

### Role Normalization
Legacy roles automatically mapped:
- `farmer` → `shipper`
- `buyer` → `receiver`
- `transporter` → `transporter`

### Bidirectional Sync
Orders and trips stay synchronized:
- Order created → Trip created
- Trip accepted → Order updated
- Trip completed → Order completed
- Cancellations propagate both ways

### Backward Compatibility
Nothing breaks:
- All old screens work
- Legacy roles supported
- Type aliases preserve old code
- Gradual migration possible
