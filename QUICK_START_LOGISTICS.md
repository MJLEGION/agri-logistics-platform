## What's New?

### 1. **Accurate Distance Calculations** âœ…
- **Old:** Incorrect math formula (gave wrong distances)
- **New:** Haversine formula (real-world accurate)
- **Auto-Fixed:** TransporterHomeScreen and AvailableLoadsScreen now use correct calculations

### 2. **Smart Load Matching** ðŸŽ¯
- Automatically scores loads based on:
  - Distance to you
  - Earnings potential
  - Profit margin
  - Urgency level
  - Your vehicle capacity
- Shows WHY each load is a good match

### 3. **Enhanced Dashboard** ðŸ“Š
- Real-time load recommendations
- Daily earning potential calculator
- Online/offline toggle
- Smart match rankings

---

## To Use the Enhanced Dashboard

### Option 1: Quick Test (No code changes)
Just navigate to the new screen manually:
```typescript
navigation.navigate('EnhancedTransporterDashboard');
```

### Option 2: Replace Home Screen (Recommended)
Update your navigation file:

**Find:** `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` or your transporter stack file

**Look for:**
```typescript
<Stack.Screen name="Home" component={TransporterHomeScreen} />
```

**Replace with:**
```typescript
import EnhancedTransporterDashboard from '../screens/transporter/EnhancedTransporterDashboard';

<Stack.Screen name="Home" component={EnhancedTransporterDashboard} />
```

**That's it!** ðŸŽ‰

## Using the New Services in Your Code

### Import Services
```typescript
import {
  calculateDistance,
  calculateEarnings,
  calculateFuelCost,
  calculateProfit
} from '../services/routeOptimizationService';

import {
  findBestMatches,
  calculateDailyEarningPotential
} from '../services/loadMatchingService';
```

### Calculate Distance
```typescript
// Kigali to Butare
const distance = calculateDistance(
  -1.9706, 30.1044,  // Kigali coordinates
  -2.5974, 29.7399   // Butare coordinates
);
console.log(distance); // ~119 km (accurate!)
```

### Calculate Earnings
```typescript
const distance = 50; // km
const earnings = calculateEarnings(distance);
console.log(earnings); // 60,000 RWF (50 km * 1200 RWF/km)

const fuelCost = calculateFuelCost(distance);
console.log(fuelCost); // ~9,000 RWF

const profit = earnings - fuelCost;
console.log(profit); // ~51,000 RWF net profit
```

### Find Best Loads
```typescript
const currentLocation = {
  latitude: -1.9706,
  longitude: 30.1044
};

const matches = findBestMatches(
  currentLocation,
  availableLoads,
  {
    maxDistance: 50,    // Only loads within 50km
    minProfit: 10000    // Minimum 10,000 RWF profit
  }
);

// Show top 3
matches.slice(0, 3).forEach(match => {
  console.log('Match Score:', match.score);
  console.log('Distance:', match.distance, 'km');
  console.log('Profit:', match.profit, 'RWF');
  console.log('Reasons:', match.matchReasons);
});
```

---

## Testing the Upgrade

### 1. **Test Distance Accuracy**
```typescript
// Test with known distance
// Kigali to Butare is ~119 km
const testDistance = calculateDistance(-1.9706, 30.1044, -2.5974, 29.7399);
console.log('Kigali to Butare:', testDistance, 'km'); // Should be ~119
```

### 2. **Test Load Matching**
```typescript
// Create a test load very close to you
const testLoad = {
  pickupLocation: { latitude: -1.97, longitude: 30.10 },
  deliveryLocation: { latitude: -1.95, longitude: 30.15 },
  quantity: 100,
  status: 'pending'
};

const matches = findBestMatches(
  { latitude: -1.97, longitude: 30.10 },
  [testLoad]
);

console.log('Match Score:', matches[0].score); // Should be high (>120)
console.log('Match Reasons:', matches[0].matchReasons); // Should include "Very close to you"
```

## Current Rates & Settings

### Earnings:
- **Rate:** 1,200 RWF per kilometer
- **Example:** 50 km trip = 60,000 RWF earnings

### Fuel Costs:
- **Price:** 1,500 RWF per liter
- **Consumption:** 12 liters per 100 km
- **Example:** 50 km trip = ~9,000 RWF fuel cost

### Net Profit:
- **Example:** 50 km trip = 60,000 - 9,000 = **51,000 RWF profit**

### Speed/ETA:
- **Default:** 60 km/h
- **Adjusts for traffic:** Low/Moderate/High/Severe

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found: routeOptimizationService"
- Make sure the file exists at: `src/services/routeOptimizationService.ts`
- Check your import path is correct

### "Match scores are all low"
- Check that loads have valid pickup/delivery locations
- Ensure currentLocation is accurate
- Try increasing maxDistance filter

### "Earnings seem wrong"
- Verify you're using `calculateEarnings` from route optimization service
- Default rate is 1,200 RWF/km
- Check that distance calculation is using Haversine formula

### "Can't see the enhanced dashboard"
- Make sure you've imported it in your navigator
- Check the screen name matches your navigation call
- Try restarting Metro bundler
