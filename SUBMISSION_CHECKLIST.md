## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: Video too long (> 5 min)**

**Solution:** Edit video to focus only on core features, cut signup/login, cut theme switching

### **Issue: Deployed app shows blank screen**

**Solution:**

```bash
# Rebuild and redeploy
npm run web
vercel --prod --force
```

### **Issue: API calls fail on deployed version**

**Solution:** Check .env variables in deployment platform settings

### **Issue: Maps don't work on web**

**Solution:** This is normal - mock data is used for development. Add note in README
