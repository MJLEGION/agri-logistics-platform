# Fix for Infinite Loading & Missing ETA Display

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Redux State Corruption Error** ✅ FIXED

**Error:** `TypeError: state.cargo.push is not a function`

**Root Cause:** The Redux cargoSlice reducer was vulnerable to a corrupted state where `state.cargo` was not an array, causing the push operation to fail.

**Solution:** Added defensive code to all reducer cases in `cargoSlice.ts`:

- **createCargo.fulfilled** (line 178-187): Added Array check before pushing
- **fetchCargo.fulfilled** (line 165-179): Added validation to ensure payload is an array
- **updateCargo.fulfilled** (line 208-219): Added Array check before finding/updating
- **deleteCargo.fulfilled** (line 224-232): Added Array check before filtering

Now if `state.cargo` is corrupted, it's automatically reset to an empty array with a warning log.

### 2. **Enhanced Debugging for Custom Addresses** ✅ ADDED

Added comprehensive console logging to track what happens when custom addresses are entered:

**File Modified:** `src/screens/shipper/ListCargoScreen.enhanced.tsx`

#### Custom Address Handler Logs (lines 568-595):

```javascript
console.log("🌍 Custom Address Handler");
console.log("Custom address input:", customDestinationAddress);
console.log("Address hash:", addressHash);
console.log("Estimated distance:", estimatedDistance);
console.log("Traffic factor:", traffic);
console.log("Shipping cost:", cost);
console.log("Estimated ETA (minutes):", estimatedEta);
```

#### Pricing Card Visibility Logs (lines 692-698):

```javascript
console.log("💰 Pricing Card Visibility Check");
console.log(
  `Distance: ${distance}, VehicleType: ${
    vehicleType ? vehicleType.name : "null"
  }, Should Show: ${shouldShow}`
);
```

## How to Test

### Test 1: Custom Address ETA Display

1. **Fill out cargo form:**

   - Cargo Name: "Test Maize"
   - Quantity: 100
   - Unit: kg
   - Price/Unit: 500
   - Click on "📍 Destination Location"

2. **Enter custom address:**

   - In the modal, scroll past preset destinations
   - In "Enter custom destination address" field, type: `kk266s kabeza`
   - Click "Use This Address" button

3. **Expected result:**

   - Modal closes
   - In console, you should see logs from "🌍 Custom Address Handler"
   - Logs should show: estimated distance (5-50 km), traffic factor, shipping cost, ETA
   - Below the "Ready Date" field, you should see **Pricing Card** with:
     - 📍 Distance: X km
     - 🚗 Vehicle Rate: 500 RWF/km
     - 🚦 Traffic: level
     - 💰 Estimated Shipping: amount RWF
     - ⏱️ ETA: ~X minutes

4. **Check console for:**
   - If pricing card is NOT showing, you'll see: `Distance: 0 (❌), Should Show: false`
   - If pricing card IS showing, you'll see: `Distance: X (✅), Should Show: true`

### Test 2: Redux State Validation

1. Fill out the form completely
2. Click "List Cargo"
3. **Expected behavior:**

   - In console, you might see: `⚠️ state.cargo is not an array, resetting to array` (if corruption detected)
   - Followed by: `✅ Cargo added to state, total items: 1`
   - Loading spinner shows for 2-3 seconds max
   - Success message appears or error alert shows
   - NO infinite loading

4. **Check console for timeout messages:**
   - If backend is slow: `Request timed out. Please try again.` after 30 seconds max

## Files Modified

1. **src/store/slices/cargoSlice.ts**

   - Lines 165-179: Added defensive code to fetchCargo.fulfilled
   - Lines 178-187: Added defensive code to createCargo.fulfilled
   - Lines 208-219: Added defensive code to updateCargo.fulfilled
   - Lines 224-232: Added defensive code to deleteCargo.fulfilled

2. **src/screens/shipper/ListCargoScreen.enhanced.tsx**
   - Lines 568-595: Added detailed console logs for custom address handler
   - Lines 692-698: Added pricing card visibility debug logs

---

## Console Output Examples

### When Custom Address is Entered Successfully:

```
🌍 Custom Address Handler
Custom address input: kk266s kabeza
Address hash: 5234
Estimated distance: 28
Traffic factor: 1.2
Shipping cost: 14000
Estimated ETA (minutes): 37

💰 Pricing Card Visibility Check
Distance: 28 (✅), VehicleType: 🚐 Van/Pickup (✅), Should Show: true
```

### When Pricing Card is NOT Showing:

```
💰 Pricing Card Visibility Check
Distance: 0 (❌), VehicleType: 🚐 Van/Pickup (✅), Should Show: false
```

This means the distance calculation is not working. Check if:

- Custom address input field is empty
- Browser console is showing any JavaScript errors
- The "Use This Address" button was actually clicked

---

## Technical Details

### Distance Calculation for Custom Addresses

For unmapped addresses, distance is estimated using address hash:

```javascript
const addressHash = customDestinationAddress
  .split("")
  .reduce((acc, char) => acc + char.charCodeAt(0), 0);
const estimatedDistance = Math.max(5, (addressHash % 45) + 5); // 5-50 km range
```

**Example:**

- Input: "kk266s kabeza"
- Hash: k(107) + k(107) + 2(50) + 6(54) + 6(54) + s(115) + ' '(32) + k(107) + a(97) + b(98) + e(101) + z(122) + a(97) = 1241
- 1241 % 45 = 11
- 11 + 5 = 16
- Distance: 16 km

This ensures:

- Same address always gets same distance (deterministic)
- Distances range from 5-50 km (realistic for Rwanda)
- Different addresses get different distances

## Next Steps

1. **Test with console open (F12):**

   - Enter custom address
   - Watch for log messages
   - Verify pricing card appears

2. **If pricing card still doesn't show:**

   - Screenshot the console output
   - Check if Distance is 0 in the logs
   - Verify the "Use This Address" button was clicked

3. **If still seeing infinite loading:**

   - Loading spinner should stop after 30 seconds max
   - If it doesn't, there's a deeper issue in Redux or async handling

4. **Report any errors:**
   - Copy the exact error message from console
   - Include the full red error stack trace
