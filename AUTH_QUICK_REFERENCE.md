   ```

   ```bash
   npm start -c
   ```

3. **Test Login**

   - Use credentials from table above
   - Try wrong password (should get error)
   - Try different roles

4. **Test Registration**

   - Try empty fields (should get errors)
   - Try short password (should get error)
   - Successfully register (should auto-login)

5. **Record Demo**
   - Show registration validation
   - Show login with wrong password → error
   - Show login with right password → success
   - Show each role's dashboard
