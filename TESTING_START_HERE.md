## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I have to run tests?**  
A: No, but strongly recommended! They ensure nothing breaks.

**Q: What if a test fails?**  
A: Read error message → Find test in test file → Fix your code → Rerun tests

**Q: Can I add more tests?**  
A: Yes! Copy existing test structure, modify for your feature, run `npm test`

**Q: What's the difference between test files?**

- `ratingService.test.ts` → Tests rating creation/stats
- `reviewService.test.ts` → Tests reviews/sentiment/moderation
- `advancedRatingsService.test.ts` → Tests leaderboards/incentives/fraud

**Q: How do I understand what a test does?**
