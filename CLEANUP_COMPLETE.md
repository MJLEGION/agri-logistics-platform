## 📊 Updated Data Model

### TransportRequest (formerly Order)

**Before** (3-role system):
```typescript
{
  _id: string;
  cropId: string;
  farmerId: string;
  buyerId: string;      ❌ REMOVED
  receiverId: string;   ❌ REMOVED
  transporterId?: string;
  totalPrice: number;   ❌ REMOVED
  // ...
}
```

**After** (2-role system):
```typescript
{
  _id: string;
  cargoId: string;           // ✅ Renamed from cropId
  shipperId: string;         // ✅ Renamed from farmerId
  transporterId?: string;    // ✅ Kept
  transportFee: number;      // ✅ Renamed from totalPrice
  pickupLocation: {          // ✅ Enhanced with contacts
    ...location,
    contactName?: string;    // ✅ NEW
    contactPhone?: string;   // ✅ NEW
  };
  deliveryLocation: {        // ✅ Enhanced with contacts
    ...location,
    contactName?: string;    // ✅ NEW
    contactPhone?: string;   // ✅ NEW
  };
  deliveryNotes?: string;    // ✅ NEW
  // ...
}
```

## 🎯 System Architecture

### Before (3-Role System)
```
Shipper → Lists cargo
    ↓
Buyer → Orders cargo
    ↓
Transporter → Delivers
```

### After (2-Role System)
```
Shipper → Requests transport + Sets delivery location
    ↓
Transporter → Delivers directly to location
```

---

## 💡 Benefits

### Simplicity
✅ **67% fewer roles** (3 → 2)
✅ **20% fewer screens** (21 → 17)
✅ **33% fewer test users** (3 → 2)
✅ **Simpler data model** (no buyerId, receiverId)

### Clarity
✅ **Direct connection** between shipper and transporter
✅ **Clear responsibilities** for each role
✅ **No confusion** about who does what
✅ **Pure logistics focus** (not marketplace)

### Flexibility
✅ **Shippers set any delivery location** (not tied to buyer accounts)
✅ **Deliver to businesses, homes, warehouses** - anywhere
✅ **Multiple delivery addresses** per shipper
✅ **Contact information** for both ends
