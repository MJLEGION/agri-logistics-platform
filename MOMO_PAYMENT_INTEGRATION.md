## 🛠️ Technical Integration

### Components:

1. **PaymentModal.tsx** - Handles all payment UI/UX
2. **flutterwaveService.ts** - Already exists, provides payment APIs
3. **cargoService.ts** - Already exists, has updateCargo method
4. **cargoSlice.ts** - Already exists, Redux thunk for cargo updates

### Data Flow:

**Shipper Payment:**

```
CargoDetailsScreen
  → handlePaymentSuccess()
    → dispatch(updateCargo())
      → cargoService.updateCargo()
        → mockCargoService.updateCargo()
          → AsyncStorage.setItem() [persist]
      → Redux state updated
      → UI refreshes
```

**Transporter Payout:**

```
EarningsDashboardScreen
  → handlePayoutSuccess()
    → Success alert with transaction reference
    → dispatch(fetchAllTrips()) [refresh]
```

## 📊 Database Schema Implications

### Cargo Object Enhancement:

```typescript
{
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  quantity: number;
  unit: string;
  status: 'listed' | 'payment_completed' | 'matched' | 'in_transit' | 'delivered';
  pricePerUnit: number;
  paymentDetails?: {
    transactionId: string;
    referenceId: string;
    amount: number;
    timestamp: string;
    method: 'flutterwave_momo';
  };
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Transaction Reference Storage:

```typescript
// Cached locally in PaymentModal for audit trail
{
  orderId: string;
  referenceId: string;
  flutterwaveRef: string;
  amount: number;
  status: "pending" | "completed" | "failed";
  timestamp: string;
}
```

## 🔐 Security Checklist

✅ Phone numbers validated before submission
✅ Email validation for both parties
✅ Amount validation before payment
✅ Transaction references logged
✅ Error messages user-friendly (don't expose sensitive info)
✅ Polling timeout (5 minutes max)
✅ AsyncStorage used for local persistence
✅ No payment data stored permanently on device
